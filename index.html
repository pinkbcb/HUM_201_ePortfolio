        <p>Welcome to my HUM 201 ePortfolio, a space where I reflect on the themes, ideas, 
            and personal insights I’ve gained throughout this course. This project goes beyond 
            memorizing historical facts or analyzing ancient texts—it’s about discovering how 
            the stories, philosophies, and artistic expressions of the Ancient and Medieval worlds 
            still shape our modern lives and identities. Through thematic analysis, personal 
            essays, and modern-day connections, I’ve explored not only key civilizations like
            Egypt, Greece, and Rome, but also what it means to be human across time. This 
            Portfolio is both an academic showcase and a personal journey, revealing how 
            the past informs the present and inspires growth for the future.</p>
