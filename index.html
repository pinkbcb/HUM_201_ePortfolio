       <p> My name is Bethany Ball, and I’m a data science student with a strong interest in 
        analytics, visualization, and problem-solving. I’m experienced in tools like R, Python, 
        and SQL, and I enjoy turning complex data into clear, meaningful insights. I’ve worked 
        on projects ranging from statistical analysis to interactive data dashboards, and I’m 
        passionate about using data to make a real-world impact.</p>

        <p>Welcome to my HUM 201 ePortfolio, a space where I reflect on the themes, ideas, 
        and personal insights I’ve gained throughout this course. This project goes beyond 
        memorizing historical facts or analyzing ancient texts—it’s about discovering how 
        the stories, philosophies, and artistic expressions of the Ancient and Medieval worlds 
        still shape our modern lives and identities. Through thematic analysis, personal 
        essays, and modern-day connections, I’ve explored not only key civilizations like
        Egypt, Greece, and Rome, but also what it means to be human across time. This 
        Portfolio is both an academic showcase and a personal journey, revealing how 
        the past informs the present and inspires growth for the future.</p>

        <p>Each theme we studied—whether centered on creation myths, heroic journeys, or the 
        struggles between fate and free will—invited me to think critically about the beliefs and 
        values that shaped early societies and continue to echo in our own. I found surprising 
        parallels between ancient narratives and modern experiences, from the search for 
        meaning in chaotic times to the role of community, power, and storytelling. Working on 
        this portfolio has pushed me to ask bigger questions about culture, identity, and how 
        we preserve—or reinterpret—history. It has also deepened my appreciation for the 
        complexity and beauty of human expression across centuries. Ultimately, this collection 
        represents not just my academic learning, but my personal engagement with the timeless 
        human effort to understand the world and our place in it.</p>
