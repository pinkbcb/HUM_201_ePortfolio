                    Herm√®s ‚Äì Messenger God and Modern Luxury Brand
                    <p>
                        Hermes was the Greek messenger god known for being quick and clever. 
                        The Herm√®s brand kinda channels that vibe with its luxury bags and 
                        accessories that feel timeless and classy. It‚Äôs like wearing something 
                        that says a lot without shouting. You‚Äôll see Herm√®s on celebrities, 
                        in fancy stores, and all over pop culture today.

                    Apollo ‚Äì God of the sun and NASA space program
                    <p>
                        Apollo was the Greek god of the sun, music, and healing‚Äîbasically a 
                        powerful and inspiring figure. NASA named their famous space program 
                        Apollo to capture that sense of reaching for the stars and doing 
                        something groundbreaking. It‚Äôs like connecting ancient ambition with 
                        modern exploration. Today, Apollo is remembered in NASA missions, 
                        museums, and space history everywhere.

                    Mars - Roman war God and candy company
                    <p>
                        Mars was the Roman god of war‚Äîstrong, bold, and a total warrior. The
                        Mars company uses that name for its candy and products to feel powerful 
                        and memorable. It‚Äôs kinda funny how a war god‚Äôs name is now on the candy 
                        we all love. You‚Äôll see Mars bars everywhere, from grocery stores to 
                        vending machines.

                    Pandora ‚Äì The First woman opened the box of troubles and music streaming service
                    <p>
                        Pandora was the first woman in Greek myth who opened a box (well, a jar) 
                        and let all the world‚Äôs troubles out. The music app Pandora took that 
                        name to hint at unlocking a whole world of sound‚Äîboth the good and the 
                        unexpected. It‚Äôs like opening a box and discovering endless playlists. 
                        You‚Äôll find it on phones, smart speakers, and pretty much anywhere 
                        people stream music.

                    Eros ‚Äì Love god (erotic, Eros International ‚Äì Bollywood film company)
                    <p>
                        Eros was the Greek god of love and attraction‚Äîthink Cupid, but with 
                        more drama. His name shows up today in words like ‚Äúerotic‚Äù and in 
                        companies like Eros International, which makes Bollywood films full of 
                        romance and emotion. It‚Äôs all about passion and connection, just like 
                        the god himself. You‚Äôll see the name in everything from movie credits 
                        to pop culture references.
