                    Herm√®s ‚Äì Messenger God and Modern Luxury Brand
                    <p>
                        Hermes was the Greek messenger god known for being quick and clever. 
                        The Herm√®s brand kinda channels that vibe with its luxury bags and 
                        accessories that feel timeless and classy. It‚Äôs like wearing something 
                        that says a lot without shouting. You‚Äôll see Herm√®s on celebrities, 
                        in fancy stores, and all over pop culture today.

                    Apollo ‚Äì God of the sun and NASA space program
                    <p>
                        Apollo was the Greek god of the sun, music, and healing‚Äîbasically a 
                        powerful and inspiring figure. NASA named their famous space program 
                        Apollo to capture that sense of reaching for the stars and doing 
                        something groundbreaking. It‚Äôs like connecting ancient ambition with 
                        modern exploration. Today, Apollo is remembered in NASA missions, 
                        museums, and space history everywhere.

                    Mars - Roman war God and candy company
                    <p>
                        Mars was the Roman god of war‚Äîstrong, bold, and a total warrior. The
                        Mars company uses that name for its candy and products to feel powerful 
                        and memorable. It‚Äôs kinda funny how a war god‚Äôs name is now on the candy 
                        we all love. You‚Äôll see Mars bars everywhere, from grocery stores to 
                        vending machines.

                    Pandora ‚Äì The First woman opened the box of troubles and music streaming service
                    <p>
                        Pandora was the first woman in Greek myth who opened a box (well, a jar) 
                        and let all the world‚Äôs troubles out. The music app Pandora took that 
                        name to hint at unlocking a whole world of sound‚Äîboth the good and the 
                        unexpected. It‚Äôs like opening a box and discovering endless playlists. 
                        You‚Äôll find it on phones, smart speakers, and pretty much anywhere 
                        people stream music.

                    Eros ‚Äì Love god (erotic, Eros International ‚Äì Bollywood film company)
                    <p>
                        Eros was the Greek god of love and attraction‚Äîthink Cupid, but with 
                        more drama. His name shows up today in words like ‚Äúerotic‚Äù and in 
                        companies like Eros International, which makes Bollywood films full of 
                        romance and emotion. It‚Äôs all about passion and connection, just like 
                        the god himself. You‚Äôll see the name in everything from movie credits 
                        to pop culture references.

            <h2>Government & Politics</h2>
                <li>
                    Senate ‚Äì Roman governing body (U.S. Senate)
                    <p>
                        The Senate started as a powerful group of elders in ancient Rome who 
                        helped run the government. The U.S. kept the name for its own Senate to 
                        show a connection to that idea of wisdom, order, and leadership. It‚Äôs 
                        like borrowing ancient structure for modern politics. You‚Äôll see it in 
                        the Capitol, on the news, and in every big national debate.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <br>
                
            <hr style="height: 2px; background-color: #333; border: none; margin: 30px 0;">

                <li>
                    Veto ‚Äì Latin ‚ÄúI forbid‚Äù (Roman political power still used)
                    <p>
                        ‚ÄúVeto‚Äù comes from Latin and means ‚ÄúI forbid‚Äù‚ÄîRoman leaders used it to 
                        block decisions they didn‚Äôt agree with. The word stuck around and now 
                        presidents and other officials still use it to shut things down. 
                        It‚Äôs a cool example of ancient power in today‚Äôs politics. You‚Äôll hear 
                        it in news stories anytime a bill gets rejected.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <br>
                
                <li>
                    Census ‚Äì Roman population count (used globally)
                    <p>
                        The census started in ancient Rome as a way to count people for taxes 
                        and military service. Today, countries all over the world still use 
                        censuses to track population and plan for things like schools, roads, 
                        and healthcare. It‚Äôs a simple idea that‚Äôs stuck around for thousands 
                        of years. You‚Äôll see it in government surveys and national stats.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    Electoral College - Inspired by Roman complex voting systems and indirect representation.
                    <p>
                        The Electoral College was inspired by how ancient Rome handled complex 
                        voting‚Äîbasically trying to give people a voice, but not too much all at 
                        once. The U.S. founders used that same idea of indirect voting to balance 
                        power between the people and the government. It‚Äôs still used today to 
                        decide who becomes president, even if it doesn‚Äôt always match the popular 
                        vote. You‚Äôll see it in every election cycle, especially when people argue about 
                        whether it‚Äôs still fair.

                <br>

                <li>
                    Tyrant - Greek tyrannos - Originally a sole ruler (not always bad), now strongly negative.
                    <p>
                        ‚ÄúTyrant‚Äù comes from the Greek word tyrannos, which just meant a single 
                        ruler‚Äîat first, it wasn‚Äôt always a bad thing. Over time though, it came 
                        to mean someone who takes power and rules in a harsh, unfair way. Now 
                        it‚Äôs a super negative word, used for cruel leaders or people who abuse power. 
                        You‚Äôll hear it in history class, political debates, or anytime someone‚Äôs 
                        being a total control freak.
