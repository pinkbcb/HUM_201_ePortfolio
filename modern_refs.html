                    Hermès – Messenger God and Modern Luxury Brand
                    <p>
                        Hermes was the Greek messenger god known for being quick and clever. 
                        The Hermès brand kinda channels that vibe with its luxury bags and 
                        accessories that feel timeless and classy. It’s like wearing something 
                        that says a lot without shouting. You’ll see Hermès on celebrities, 
                        in fancy stores, and all over pop culture today.

                    Apollo – God of the sun and NASA space program
                    <p>
                        Apollo was the Greek god of the sun, music, and healing—basically a 
                        powerful and inspiring figure. NASA named their famous space program 
                        Apollo to capture that sense of reaching for the stars and doing 
                        something groundbreaking. It’s like connecting ancient ambition with 
                        modern exploration. Today, Apollo is remembered in NASA missions, 
                        museums, and space history everywhere.

                    Mars - Roman war God and candy company
                    <p>
                        Mars was the Roman god of war—strong, bold, and a total warrior. The
                        Mars company uses that name for its candy and products to feel powerful 
                        and memorable. It’s kinda funny how a war god’s name is now on the candy 
                        we all love. You’ll see Mars bars everywhere, from grocery stores to 
                        vending machines.

                    Pandora – The First woman opened the box of troubles and music streaming service
                    <p>
                        Pandora was the first woman in Greek myth who opened a box (well, a jar) 
                        and let all the world’s troubles out. The music app Pandora took that 
                        name to hint at unlocking a whole world of sound—both the good and the 
                        unexpected. It’s like opening a box and discovering endless playlists. 
                        You’ll find it on phones, smart speakers, and pretty much anywhere 
                        people stream music.

                    Eros – Love god (erotic, Eros International – Bollywood film company)
                    <p>
                        Eros was the Greek god of love and attraction—think Cupid, but with 
                        more drama. His name shows up today in words like “erotic” and in 
                        companies like Eros International, which makes Bollywood films full of 
                        romance and emotion. It’s all about passion and connection, just like 
                        the god himself. You’ll see the name in everything from movie credits 
                        to pop culture references.

            <h2>Government & Politics</h2>
                <li>
                    Senate – Roman governing body (U.S. Senate)
                    <p>
                        The Senate started as a powerful group of elders in ancient Rome who 
                        helped run the government. The U.S. kept the name for its own Senate to 
                        show a connection to that idea of wisdom, order, and leadership. It’s 
                        like borrowing ancient structure for modern politics. You’ll see it in 
                        the Capitol, on the news, and in every big national debate.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <br>
                
                <li>
                    Veto – Latin “I forbid” (Roman political power still used)
                    <p>
                        “Veto” comes from Latin and means “I forbid”—Roman leaders used it to 
                        block decisions they didn’t agree with. The word stuck around and now 
                        presidents and other officials still use it to shut things down. 
                        It’s a cool example of ancient power in today’s politics. You’ll hear 
                        it in news stories anytime a bill gets rejected.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <br>
                
                <li>
                    Census – Roman population count (used globally)
                    <p>
                        The census started in ancient Rome as a way to count people for taxes 
                        and military service. Today, countries all over the world still use 
                        censuses to track population and plan for things like schools, roads, 
                        and healthcare. It’s a simple idea that’s stuck around for thousands 
                        of years. You’ll see it in government surveys and national stats.

                    Electoral College - Inspired by Roman complex voting systems and indirect representation.
                    <p>
                        The Electoral College was inspired by how ancient Rome handled complex 
                        voting—basically trying to give people a voice, but not too much all at 
                        once. The U.S. founders used that same idea of indirect voting to balance 
                        power between the people and the government. It’s still used today to 
                        decide who becomes president, even if it doesn’t always match the popular 
                        vote. You’ll see it in every election cycle, especially when people argue about 
                        whether it’s still fair.

                <li>
                    Tyrant - Greek tyrannos - Originally a sole ruler (not always bad), now strongly negative.
                    <p>
                        “Tyrant” comes from the Greek word tyrannos, which just meant a single 
                        ruler—at first, it wasn’t always a bad thing. Over time though, it came 
                        to mean someone who takes power and rules in a harsh, unfair way. Now 
                        it’s a super negative word, used for cruel leaders or people who abuse power. 
                        You’ll hear it in history class, political debates, or anytime someone’s 
                        being a total control freak.

            <h2>Religion & Symbols</h2>
                <li>
                    Cross – Ancient Roman execution tool to modern religious symbol
                    <p>
                        The cross started out as a brutal Roman method of execution—pretty much the 
                        worst way to go. It was used to punish criminals and rebels in a really public, 
                        painful way. But over time, especially after the crucifixion of Jesus, it 
                        totally flipped in meaning. Now it’s one of the most recognized religious symbols 
                        in the world, especially in Christianity, where it stands for sacrifice, hope, 
                        and salvation. You’ll see it everywhere: on churches, necklaces, even tattoos. 
                        It’s wild how something that once meant death now means life to so many.

                    Monk – From medieval devotion to modern pop culture wisdom
                    <p>
                        Monks were once the ultimate example of religious dedication—living in quiet 
                        monasteries, copying texts by hand, and praying basically 24/7. Today, we still 
                        use “monk” to talk about super disciplined people, especially in yoga or 
                        mindfulness circles. You’ll also find them popping up in movies or games as 
                        wise, mysterious characters (or bald guys with robes and epic fighting skills).

                    Alpha and Omega – Greek letters turned spiritual symbol
                    <p>
                        “Alpha and Omega” are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, and in 
                        Christian tradition, they mean God is the beginning and the end of everything. 
                        You’ll still hear it in church, but it also shows up in books, tattoos, and 
                        even sci-fi where it sounds all epic and mysterious. It’s like a shortcut for 
                        “ultimate power” or “eternal presence.”

                    Halo – From divine glow to gamer icon
                    <p>
                        A halo used to mean you were holy—literally a glowing ring around your head in 
                        medieval paintings to show you’re a saint or angel. Now? It's still that in religious 
                        art, but it’s also one of the most iconic video game franchises out there. 
                        Plus, people use it in jokes or memes—like someone pretending to be innocent 
                        with a “halo” over their head.

                    <p>
                       The ankh was an Egyptian symbol for life—kinda like a cross with a loop on top. 
                        It was everywhere in tombs and carvings. Fast forward to now, and you’ll see it 
                        in fashion, jewelry, tattoos, and even on album covers. People use it as a 
                        symbol of eternal life, mystery, or just cool ancient vibes.

                    The Hunger Games – Gladiator vibes with a modern twist
                    <p>
                        “The Hunger Games” may be fiction, but it totally draws from Roman gladiator 
                        fights—making kids battle for survival to entertain the rich? That’s straight 
                        out of the Colosseum playbook. It’s a modern story, but packed with ancient 
                        themes of power, rebellion, and using violence as a show.

                    Wonder Woman – Amazonian warrior meets modern hero
                    <p>
                       Wonder Woman is based on the Amazons—fierce warrior women from Greek myths who didn’t need 
                        anyone to rescue them. The comics took that and ran with it, turning her into a symbol 
                        of strength, justice, and girl power. Her roots are ancient, but she’s all about modern empowerment.

                    <p>
                       “Clash of the Titans” is full-on Greek mythology, with gods, monsters, and 
                        heroic quests. It’s not just a movie—it’s a modern retelling of stories 
                        that people were telling thousands of years ago. We keep going back to those 
                        old myths because they’re dramatic, wild, and honestly still relatable.

                    <p>
                        Game of Thrones may be fantasy, but it feels medieval: castles, knights, 
                        betrayal, royal families fighting over thrones. A lot of it is inspired 
                        by real history like the Wars of the Roses or feudal Europe. The show 
                        makes ancient power struggles feel super real—even if there's a dragon or two.

                        The Lion King isn’t just a Disney movie—it’s based on Hamlet, which is 
                        based on even older stories of royal revenge. Plus, the whole “circle of life” 
                        and tribal structure has echoes of traditional African culture and ancient 
                        storytelling. It's a remix of old themes with animal characters.

                        peace (and flex a little). Even the torch and wreaths are throwbacks.

                       The marathon gets its name from a legend about a Greek messenger who 
                        ran from Marathon to Athens to deliver battle news, then collapsed 
                        and died (ouch). Today, people train for months just to run that same 
                        26.2 miles—for fun! It’s ancient endurance turned modern achievement.

                    Laurel Wreath – Victory crown from Rome to graduation day
                    <p>
                        In ancient Greece and Rome, champions and poets were crowned with laurel 
                        wreaths—basically the OG gold medal. Now you see them in logos, trophies, 
                        and even around college seals or graduation hats. They still mean you’re 
                        the best of the best.

                    Roman Numerals in the Super Bowl – Ancient numbers, modern hype
                    <p>
                        Roman numerals were the standard way to count in ancient Rome, and for some reason, 
                        we still use them for the Super Bowl—maybe to make it feel more legendary? Super 
                        Bowl LVIII just sounds fancier than 58. It’s tradition with a dramatic twist.

                    Michigan State Spartans (NCAA) – Greek warriors as team spirit
                    <p>
                        The Spartans were famous Greek soldiers—tough, disciplined, and unbeatable. 
                        Michigan State picked that name to bring all those warrior vibes to their 
                        team. Even the mascot rocks a helmet and cape. It’s ancient battle pride 
                        turned school spirit.
